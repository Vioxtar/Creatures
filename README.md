# Creatures

Creatures (work in progress) is a fun, educational project that features an artistic exploration of artificial life, developed with OpenGL and C++.
Through selection of the fittest, thousands of creatures evolve to become better reproductive beings, and as a byproduct - develop artificial intelligence to assist them in this task.
The selection of the fittest is natural; there is no predefined/hard-coded fitness function.

By leveraging GPU acceleration, the simulation can support tens of thousands of creatures simulatenously - accelerating the probablistic mutation driven evolution process.
