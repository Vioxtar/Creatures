# Creatures

Creatures (work in progress) is a fun, educational project that offers an artistic exploration of artificial life, developed with OpenGL and C++.
Through selection of the fittest, thousands of creatures evolve to become better reproductive beings, and as a byproduct - develop artificial intelligence.
The selection of the fittest is natural; there is no predefined or hard-coded fitness function involved.

By leveraging GPU acceleration, the simulation can support tens of thousands of creatures simulatenously - accelerating the process of evolution (which relies on probablistic mutations). Additionally, the simulation is physics based, and features a simplified model of fluid dynamics, which dictates the nature of creature-to-creature interactions.
